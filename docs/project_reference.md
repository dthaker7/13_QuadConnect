# QuadConnect — Project Reference

> Single source of truth. Read this before touching anything.
> Plain markdown - readable by the whole team and by any tooling.

### Why this file exists

It is the team's **accumulated memory**. Every assignment, every branch, every
decision that cost someone an hour ends up here, so that six weeks from now
nobody has to reverse-engineer why `MatchParticipant.profile` is `PROTECT` or
why there is no `settings.py`.

It grows as we work: each developer records their branch before merging, and
the person doing the merge folds those entries into a single history. The rule
is simple — **if you learned it the hard way, write it down here.**

This file is kept for our own reference and is **not part of any Canvas
submission**. That is deliberate: it can be blunt about what went wrong,
what we chose not to build, and where the shortcuts are.

## 0. CURRENT STATE — read this first

| | |
|---|---|
| **Repo** | `13_QuadConnect` |
| **Assignment in flight** | **P1-A7** — Multi-Model AI Systems (250 pts, group): Part 1 benchmarking (done on the branch), Part 2 cost at six traffic levels and Part 3 routing (next) — built on `feature/p1-a7-part-1` in `multi-model/`, not part of the Django app, due Mon 2026-10-26 |
| **Last completed** | P1-A6 — Text Intelligence (100 pts) — merged into `main` (PR #11, 2026-10-19) |
| **`main` status** | Has P1-A2 to P1-A6 (`fd89f6b`, PR #11). `feature/p1-a7-part-1` was cut from it. |
| **What remains** | P1-A7 Parts 2 and 3, then a PR into `main` and the Canvas submission (§9, §12). |

`main` ships P1-A2 (split settings, `.env` handling, `base.html`, the shared
list template, a home dashboard and the four graded views), P1-A3 (detail
pages, search, static files with cache busting, Matplotlib charts, a POST form
on a CBV, a JSON API) and P1-A4 (chart-ready API endpoints, two Vega-Lite
charts, Open Trivia DB icebreakers, CSV/JSON exports with a reports page, the
committed seed database) and P1-A5 (accounts with django-allauth, every page
private by default, Google sign-in, one public API). `feature/p1-a6` adds
everything in §9's P1-A6 entry: the model lab in `llm-test/`, "Ask in plain
English" (a local Hugging Face model) and the automatic check of venue
suggestions (an external API). CI: every push to `feature/p1-a6` runs one
check, **Deploy / test (push)** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`), with every
CI step inside that one job. It runs on no other branch: code reaches `main`
only through a PR whose head has passed it.

### Status board — UPDATE YOUR ROW WHEN YOU FINISH

| Owner | Branch | View kind | Route | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kritika Agrawal | `feature/profile-views` | Generic CBV | `/students/` | ✅ DONE — `StudentProfileListView` + `DetailView`, `?college=` filter, default template naming |
| Manojkumar Mohankumar | `feature/match-views` | FBV `render()` | `/matches/` | ✅ DONE — `match_list` with `?week=` filter, renders the shared list template |
| Prathamesh Mulay | `feature/location-views` | Base CBV | `/locations/` | ✅ DONE — `CampusLocationListView` base CBV with setting + seats filters, reuses the shared list template |
| Dhruv Thaker | `feature/feedback-views` | FBV `HttpResponse` | `/feedback/summary/` | ✅ DONE — aggregate feedback summary with rating distribution, enjoyment metrics, and connection preferences |
| Manojkumar Mohankumar (P1-A3, solo) | `feature/p1-a3` | all six A3 sections | `/search/`, `/matches/<pk>/`, `/locations/<pk>/`, `/insights/`, `/api/` | ✅ DONE — merged to `main` in PR #6 (2026-09-28); see §9 |
| Manojkumar Mohankumar (P1-A4) | `feature/p1-a4` | all four A4 parts | `/api/summary/`, `/vega-lite/...`, `/api/icebreakers/`, `/reports/`, `/export/...` | ✅ DONE — merged to `main` in PR #9 (2026-10-05); live at <https://manojkmohan43.pythonanywhere.com/>; see §9 |
| Manojkumar Mohankumar (P1-A5) | `feature/p1-a5` | Parts 1–4 | `/accounts/...`, every route behind a login, `/api/summary/` public | ✅ DONE — merged to `main` in PR #10 (2026-10-12); deployed 2026-10-09; see §9 |
| Manojkumar Mohankumar (P1-A6) | `feature/p1-a6` | Parts 1–3 | `/search/ask/`, the venue check on `/locations/`, `llm-test/` | ✅ DONE — merged to `main` in PR #11 (2026-10-19); see §9 |
| Manojkumar Mohankumar (P1-A7) | `feature/p1-a7-part-1` | Part 1 of 3 | `multi-model/` (not Django) | BUILDING — Part 1 done 2026-10-24; Parts 2–3 next; see §9 |

**Whoever completes a branch:** updating this file is
**Step 7 of that developer's build task** and a box on their Done
checklist. It is not optional and it is not housekeeping — it is how the team
keeps a memory. Before the final commit on their branch:

1. Change their row above to `DONE — <one-line summary of what shipped>`.
2. Replace their block in **§9 Work log** using the template documented there:
   what shipped, files added/changed, decisions that differ from the build
   task, gotchas for the next person, and what was verified.
3. Add any new gotcha to **§11 Traps**.

Keep edits confined to your own row and your own block — four people edit this
file. Git merges different lines cleanly but conflicts on the same line.

### Merge protocol — repo owner

Branches merge into `main` **one at a time**, never in parallel. After each
merge:

1. Keep the incoming work-log block as written by its author.
2. Flip that row on the status board if the author did not.
3. Append a short merge entry to §9 noting anything that only surfaced during
   integration — a conflict, a behaviour that broke when two branches met, a
   decision reversed.

When all four are merged, §9 is the complete story of P1-A2 and this file is
handed forward to the next assignment as-is.

## 2. What the product is

A verified, student-only platform that helps UIUC students form real
friendships through **structured, in-person experiences**.

Core thesis: *the problem is not a lack of people to meet — it is finding
compatible people and a comfortable context in which to meet them.*

### What it deliberately is NOT

Every one of these is a decision, not an omission:

- **No endless messaging.** Matching exists to produce one scheduled meeting.
- **No swiping, no feed, no browsing.** Exactly one match per week.
- **No open sign-up.** UIUC SSO only; a closed community is the safety model.
- **No public profiles.** Identity is withheld until both sides accept.
- **No unilateral connections.** A lasting connection requires mutual opt-in.
- **No machine learning in matching.** Matching is a deterministic weighted
  score over hard constraints plus soft signals. Never describe the matching
  as ML — the paper, the data model and the TCC must stay consistent. P1-A6
  added language models that read text, and nothing else: "Ask in plain
  English" turns a sentence into allow-listed search filters, and the venue
  check gives staff advice. Neither decides a match, and neither approves
  anything.

### Five design principles

1. **Verified community** — institutional authentication gates participation.
2. **Intentional matching** — interests, preferences, availability, campus
   involvement; never random pairing.
3. **Offline-first** — technology exists to produce a real-world meeting.
4. **User control and safety** — approved public locations, check-in,
   reporting, private feedback.
5. **Feedback loop** — post-experience feedback improves future matching.

### Two connection types

- **Friend Connect** — one-to-one, weekly, in person.
- **Squad Connect** — small group of 4–8 students, weekly, in person.

## 3. The nine screens

| # | Screen | Purpose | Backed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | UIUC SSO Login | Verified student-only entry | `StudentProfile` |
| 2 | Interests & Hobbies | Hobbies, RSOs, college/dept, optional job | `Interest`, `ProfileInterest` |
| 3 | Choose Connection Type | Friend vs Squad | `StudentProfile.preferred_connection` |
| 4 | Social Preferences | Energy, style, environment, group, age, degree, RSO | `StudentProfile` |
| 5 | Availability | Weekend slots, activities, indoor/outdoor | `AvailabilitySlot` |
| 6 | Weekly Friend Match | The match + *why you matched* + suggested experience | `Match`, `MatchParticipant` |
| 7 | Squad Connect Match | Group of 4–8, shared interests, experience | `Match`, `MatchParticipant` |
| 8 | Meeting & Check-in | Location, arrival steps, QR + short code | `CampusLocation`, `MatchParticipant.checked_in_at` |
| 9 | Post-Experience Feedback | Rating, enjoyment, per-person stay-connected | `ExperienceFeedback` |

**Flow:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → weekly matching cycle → (6 **or** 7) → 8 → 9 →
mutual connection. Screens 2–5 are a four-step wizard. Branching happens once,
at the match; both branches reconverge at check-in.

None of these screens are implemented yet. P1-A2 builds four *list* views over
the same models as a foundation.

### Interaction rules from the wireframes

- Chips are multi-select toggles with a live count.
- Primary buttons stay **disabled with an explanatory line** — never silently.
- Radios for single-choice, checkboxes for multi-choice, so control shape
  signals how many answers are allowed.
- On Screen 3 the entire card is the hit target.
- Screen 8 offers **two** check-in methods (QR + short code) so a dead battery
  cannot block attendance.
- Screen 9 requires only the star rating.
- The Screen 8 safety banner is persistent and not dismissible.

### Naming rationale

- **`quadconnect`** (project) — the deployable product as a whole.
- **`connect`** (app) — the one core domain: the lifecycle that turns two
  verified students into a completed in-person experience. Chosen over `core`
  or `main` (say nothing) and over `matching` (describes only the middle,
  orphaning onboarding and feedback).

Future sibling apps as scope grows: `events`, `assistant`.

---

## 5. Settings and environment

Settings are a **package**, not a module. Pick one with
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`.

| | Module | `DEBUG` | `ALLOWED_HOSTS` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Development | `quadconnect.settings.development` | `True` | localhost, 127.0.0.1 |
| Production | `quadconnect.settings.production` | `False` | **required** from env |

`manage.py` defaults to development; `wsgi.py`/`asgi.py` default to production,
so a real deployment cannot boot with `DEBUG=True`.

Production **fails fast**: unset `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` raises `RuntimeError`
at startup rather than silently serving any `Host` header. With
`DJANGO_SECURE_SSL=1`, `check --deploy` reports **zero issues** (HSTS, SSL
redirect, secure cookies all switch on).

**Static files (A3).** `STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / "static"]`. WhiteNoise
serves them in both environments (`WhiteNoiseMiddleware` straight after
`SecurityMiddleware`, and `whitenoise.runserver_nostatic` so dev behaves like
prod). Production uses `CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage`: content-hashed
names, `immutable` caching, gzip. **Production needs
`collectstatic --noinput` before it starts**; development does not.

### `.env` keys

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | Signing key. Required. Rotated when it left source. |
| `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` | Which settings module to load. |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated. Required in production. |
| `DJANGO_SECURE_SSL` | `1` behind real TLS. |
| `MAPS_API_KEY` | Placeholder for the Screen 8 map. Dummy value. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client (A5). Required in production; in development, empty hides the Google button. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | That client's secret. Required when the ID is set. Never in the database. |
| `DJANGO_DB_PATH` | Optional SQLite path. The live site's database lives outside the repository. |
| `AI_LOCAL_ENABLED`, `AI_LOCAL_MODEL`, `AI_LOCAL_MAX_SECONDS` | (A6) The local model for "Ask in plain English": on/off, its Hugging Face id, its time limit. |
| `AI_API_PROVIDER`, `AI_API_MODEL` | (A6) The venue check's API (`groq`, `openrouter`, `gemini`, `huggingface`) and an optional model. |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` (or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `AI_API_KEY`) | (A6) That provider's key. Without one, suggestions are saved "not checked" and nothing is sent. |
| `HF_TOKEN` | (A6) Optional Hugging Face token: faster downloads, and the key for `AI_API_PROVIDER=huggingface`. |

## 6. Data model — 8 models

All in `connect/models.py`. **Frozen for P1-A2** — do not add fields or
migrations. Every model has a class docstring, `Meta.ordering`, and `__str__`.

### Choice vocabularies

```python
ConnectionType      FRIEND | SQUAD
SocialEnergy        1 QUIET · 2 RESERVED · 3 BALANCED · 4 OUTGOING · 5 VERY_SOCIAL
ConversationStyle   CASUAL | DEEP | ACTIVITY
GroupPreference     ONE | SMALL | EITHER
Weekday             6 SATURDAY | 7 SUNDAY          (ISO numbering, Mon=1)
TimeBlock           10-12 | 12-14 | 14-16 | 16-18  (four 2-hour windows)
InterestCategory    HOBBY | RSO | ACTIVITY
MatchStatus         PROPOSED | CONFIRMED | COMPLETED | CANCELLED
ParticipantResponse PENDING | ACCEPTED | DECLINED
```

Always choices, never free text, so comparison needs no string normalisation.

### `StudentProfile`
SSO-verified student + every matching signal. Separate from `auth.User` so
authentication can be swapped for real Shibboleth SSO without touching
product data.

```
user  OneToOne -> auth.User  CASCADE UNIQUE   net_id CharField UNIQUE
illinois_email EmailField UNIQUE              full_name, college, department,
preferred_connection  ConnectionType          part_time_job  CharField
social_energy SocialEnergy                    conversation_style ConversationStyle
group_preference GroupPreference              prefers_same_age Boolean
prefers_shared_rso Boolean                    open_to_other_departments Boolean
interests M2M -> Interest through ProfileInterest
is_sso_verified Boolean  (False = out of the matching pool)
onboarding_completed_at DateTime null         created_at DateTime auto_now_add
Meta.ordering ["full_name","net_id"]   UC (net_id, illinois_email)
```

### `Interest`
Shared vocabulary behind the chip pickers, so "Gaming" means the same thing
for everyone and overlap is countable.

```
name CharField   category InterestCategory   is_active Boolean
Meta.ordering ["category","name"]   UC (name, category)
```
Per-category uniqueness so "Sports" can be both a HOBBY and an ACTIVITY.

### `ProfileInterest` — M2M through-model
Explicit so a selection can carry weight (`is_primary` = starred).

```
profile FK -> StudentProfile CASCADE    interest FK -> Interest PROTECT
is_primary Boolean    selected_at DateTime auto_now_add
Meta.ordering ["profile","-is_primary","interest"]   UC (profile, interest)
```

### `AvailabilitySlot`
Rows not a blob, because availability is a **hard constraint** — the
intersection must be a DB query.

```
profile FK -> StudentProfile CASCADE   weekday Weekday   time_block TimeBlock
Meta.ordering ["profile","weekday","time_block"]
UC (profile, weekday, time_block)
```

### `CampusLocation`
Approved public meeting places. In the DB rather than free text, which is what
makes "approved locations only" enforceable.

```
name CharField UNIQUE   street_address   arrival_note   is_indoor Boolean
capacity PositiveSmallInt 2..50          is_approved Boolean
ai_decision VenueCheck blank  ai_flags  ai_reason  ai_checked_by  ai_checked_at
            (A6: the automatic check of a suggestion; advice for staff only,
             set by connect/ai_venues.py, read-only in Admin)
Meta.ordering ["name"]
```

### `Match`
One weekly scheduled experience — the central object.

```
connection_type ConnectionType   week_start DateField (Monday)
scheduled_for DateTimeField      location FK -> CampusLocation PROTECT
suggested_activity FK -> Interest SET_NULL null
                   limit_choices_to={"category": ACTIVITY}
status MatchStatus               check_in_code CharField UNIQUE  "QC-4827"
Meta.ordering ["-week_start","-scheduled_for"]
```

### `MatchParticipant`
One student's place in one match. Its own model because membership carries
state belonging to the pairing, not to either side.

```
match FK -> Match CASCADE        profile FK -> StudentProfile PROTECT
response ParticipantResponse     compatibility_score Decimal(5,2) 0..100
match_reason CharField  (renders "Why you matched" on Screen 6)
checked_in_at DateTime null
Meta.ordering ["match","-compatibility_score","profile"]
UC (match, profile)
```

### `ExperienceFeedback`
Private post-meeting feedback. One-to-one with a *participant row*, not a
student, because one review exists per experience.

```
participant OneToOne -> MatchParticipant CASCADE UNIQUE
rating PositiveSmallInt 1..5
enjoyed_conversation / enjoyed_shared_interests /
enjoyed_activity / felt_comfortable   Boolean
wants_to_stay_connected Boolean   (mutual opt-in gate)
private_note TextField            NEVER shown to other participants
submitted_at DateTime auto_now_add
Meta.ordering ["-submitted_at"]
```

### Relationship map

### `on_delete` — the reasoning must survive

| Relation | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `StudentProfile.user` | CASCADE | Orphaning strands personal data unreachable through the account. |
| `AvailabilitySlot.profile` | CASCADE | Worthless without the student. |
| `ProfileInterest.profile` | CASCADE | No meaning without who made it. |
| `ProfileInterest.interest` | **PROTECT** | Deleting a picked catalogue entry silently rewrites profiles and invalidates past match explanations. Retire with `is_active=False`. |
| `Match.location` | **PROTECT** | A past meeting must always say where it happened. Retire with `is_approved=False`. |
| `Match.suggested_activity` | **SET_NULL** | A prompt, not part of the meeting's identity. |
| `MatchParticipant.match` | CASCADE | Describes a place inside one meeting. |
| `MatchParticipant.profile` | **PROTECT** | Deleting a student mid-cycle silently shrinks a squad others plan to attend. Withdrawal must be explicit. |
| `ExperienceFeedback.participant` | CASCADE | Unattributable without the attendance. |

Pattern: **CASCADE** when the child is a detail of its parent · **PROTECT**
when deletion destroys history or affects a third party · **SET_NULL** when
the link is genuinely optional.

### The five `UniqueConstraint`s

`uniq_profile_netid_email` · `uniq_interest_name_per_category` ·
`uniq_interest_per_profile` · `uniq_slot_per_profile_day_block` ·
`uniq_participant_per_match`

> **Django limitation:** `UniqueConstraint` cannot span relations. "One match
> per student per week" (`profile`, `match__week_start`) is **not expressible**
> and was removed. Enforce it in the matching service layer.

## 7. Views and routes

`connect/views.py` is divided into commented sections, one per owner. Stay in
yours.

| Path | Name | Kind | Owner | Template |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | `connect:home` | dashboard | shared/`main` | `home.html` |
| `/privacy/` | `connect:privacy` | FBV `render()`, public | A5 | `privacy.html` |
| `/students/` | `connect:student-list` | Generic CBV | Kritika | `studentprofile_list.html` (default naming) |
| `/students/<pk>/` | `connect:student-detail` | Generic CBV | Kritika | `studentprofile_detail.html` |
| `/matches/` | `connect:match-list` | FBV `render()` | Manojkumar | `entity_list.html` (shared) |
| `/locations/` | `connect:location-list` | Base CBV | Prathamesh | `entity_list.html` (shared) |
| `/feedback/summary/` | `connect:feedback-summary` | FBV `HttpResponse` | Dhruv | `feedback_summary.html` |
| `/search/` | `connect:student-search` | Base CBV, GET+POST | A3 | `student_search.html` |
| `/search/ask/` | `connect:student-ask` | FBV `render()`, GET; a local language model reads the request | A6 | `student_ask.html` |
| `/matches/<pk>/` | `connect:match-detail` | Generic CBV | A3 | `match_detail.html` (default naming) |
| `/locations/<pk>/` | `connect:location-detail` | Generic CBV | A3 | `campuslocation_detail.html` (default naming) |
| `/insights/` + two `.png` | `connect:insights`, `connect:chart-*` | FBV, `image/png` | A3 | `insights.html` |
| `/api/`, `/api/locations/`, `/api/matches/`, `/api/locations.txt` | `connect:api-*` | CBV + FBV, `JsonResponse` / `HttpResponse` | A3 | `api_docs.html` for `/api/` |
| `/api/summary/`, `/api/summary/matches-per-week/` | `connect:api-summary*` | FBV, `JsonResponse`; `/api/summary/` public with CORS `*` (A5) | A4 | — |
| `/vega-lite/<chart>.vl.json`, `.png`, `.jpg` | `connect:vega-spec`, `connect:vega-image` | FBV, JSON / image | A4 | — |
| `/api/icebreakers/?match=<id>`, `/matches/<pk>/icebreakers/` | `connect:api-icebreakers`, `connect:match-icebreakers` | FBV, calls Open Trivia DB | A4 | `icebreakers.html` |
| `/reports/`, `/export/students.csv`, `/export/students.json` | `connect:reports`, `connect:export-students-*` | FBV, `render()` / attachments | A4 | `reports.html` |

`/locations/` also gained `post()` in A3 (venue suggestions), and in A6 that
`post()` runs the automatic check before it saves. Everything is
namespaced: `{% url 'connect:match-list' %}`. Links to a single record always
go through `get_absolute_url()` (`StudentProfile`, `Match`, `CampusLocation`).

**Access (A5).** `connect.middleware.LoginRequiredMiddleware` makes every
view private. A view opens to everyone only with `@login_not_required`: today
`home`, `privacy` and `summary_api`, plus allauth's own sign-in views. A signed-out page
request redirects to `/accounts/login/?next=...`, and an `/api/` request gets
`401` JSON. A new view is private unless you mark it, so decide on purpose,
and add a public one to `PUBLIC_ROUTES` in `tests_a5.py`. The account pages
live under `/accounts/` (allauth's URLs), with the site's templates in the
project-level `templates/account/`.

### Template architecture

- **`base.html`** — owned by `main`. Document shell, nav, palette, footer.
  Provides `{% block title %}`, `{% block heading %}`, `{% block subtitle %}`,
  `{% block content %}`, `{% block extra_css %}`.
  **Never edited from a feature branch** — that is the one guaranteed four-way
  conflict, designed out by pre-naming every route. (In practice A3, A4, A5
  and A6 each changed `base.html` on their own feature branch and merged it
  through a pull request; see their entries in §9. Keep such changes small
  and list them in the entry.)
- **`entity_list.html`** — shared, model-agnostic. Renders a list of plain
  dicts (`title`, `subtitle`, `meta`, `badge`, `url`) so the template does not
  know what a Match or a CampusLocation is. Two owners render it from
  different view styles; that is the "template reuse" deliverable.
  A3 added `{% block after_list %}` below the list (the venue form uses it).
- ~~CSS is inline in `base.html`~~ (A2). Since A3 the design lives in
  `static/css/quadconnect.css`, loaded with `{% static %}`, and WhiteNoise
  keeps `DEBUG=False` rendering. No `style=""` attributes in templates except
  the data-driven width of the rating bars. `base.html` also gained
  `{% block page_header %}` (home replaces it with the hero) and a flash
  message region. A4 added `{% block scripts %}` at the end of `<body>`
  (Insights loads the Vega scripts there) and a ninth nav link, Reports.

### Superusers — both, password `uiuc12345`

`mohitg2` (named in P1-A1 section 4) and `tester` (named in its checklist).
The assignment contradicted itself; both exist.

### Seeded data

8 profiles across 6 colleges · 28 interests (12 hobby, 10 RSO, 6 activity) ·
41 interest selections · 16 availability slots · 4 campus locations (Illini
Union, Grainger Library, Main Quad, Espresso Royale) · 19 matches over nine
weeks (2026-07-13 to 2026-09-07): the original three keep ids 1–3
(`QC-4827` Friend/PROPOSED, `QC-5193` Squad/CONFIRMED with check-ins,
`QC-3312` Friend/COMPLETED), and A4 added 16 past ones (`QC-1301`–`QC-1316`,
one cancelled) for the matches-per-week chart · 55 participants · 33 feedback
rows · staff `tester` and `mohitg2`. Sign-up dates are fixed, so reseeding
changes nothing.

### `verify_constraints` — 11 checks

5 uniqueness violations → `IntegrityError`; 3 PROTECT blocks →
`ProtectedError`; 2 CASCADE removals; 1 SET_NULL survival. **Every check runs
inside a rolled-back transaction**, so the database is never mutated. Preserve
that property when adding checks.

## 9. Work log

The running history of what has actually been built. Newest at the top.

### BUILDING `feature/p1-a7-part-1` - Manojkumar Mohankumar - 2026-10-24
**Shipped so far:** P1-A7 Part 1 (model size selection and benchmarking), on a
branch cut from `main` at `fd89f6b`. The assignment is independent of the
Django app, so everything is in `multi-model/`.
- `multi_model_system.ipynb`: the same 15 models as A6 in A6's five size
  categories, 5 prompt types QuadConnect needs (structured extraction,
  classification, prediction, summarization, text generation) × 5 prompts,
  375 replies with latency, tokens/sec and time to first token, each scored
  1–10 by a rubric in code (accuracy gates the score), a hand spot check of 20
  replies, a timing check, and the Step 1.6 analysis.
- `system_design.md`: Part 1's architectural conclusions (three model tiers).
- `results/`: `runs.jsonl` (every reply, resumable), `benchmark_table.csv`,
  `manual_check.json`.

**Files changed:** `README.md` (P1-A7 section, layout), `ruff.toml` (E402 for
the new notebook), the CI workflow (now runs on `feature/p1-a7-part-1`), this file,
notes.txt.

**Gotchas:** a laptop that sleeps mid-run stalls a reply (one took 43 minutes);
the notebook's timing check finds such replies, and deleting them from
`runs.jsonl` and re-running regenerates only them.

**Each developer replaces their own placeholder block before merging**, using
this exact shape so every entry reads the same way and the merged file stays
scannable:

```markdown
### DONE `feature/<branch>` - <Name> - YYYY-MM-DD
**Shipped:** one sentence on what it does.
**Files added:** paths.
**Files changed:** paths, and what changed in each.
**Decisions that differ from the build task:** what and why, or "none".
**Gotchas for the next person:** what surprised you or cost you time, or "none".
**Verified:** check clean / route 200 / empty state renders / screenshot saved.
```

**At merge time** the repo owner reviews each incoming block, keeps it, and
adds a short merge entry of their own recording anything that only became
visible when the branches came together — conflicts hit, behaviour that broke
on integration, decisions reversed. That merge entry is the part that is
easiest to skip and most valuable later.

### DONE `feature/p1-a6` - Manojkumar Mohankumar - 2026-10-19
**Shipped:** all three P1-A6 parts on one branch cut from `main` at
`df81e3b`. Route A (prompt engineering), chosen because the instructor's
machine must download a pre-trained model by itself.
- Part 1: `llm-test/ai_prototype.ipynb`. Its first code cell downloads the
  weights. It picks 15 models from the Open LLM Leaderboard's own dataset (3
  per size category: Qwen2.5 at every size, plus the two best non-gated models
  of other families by IFEval), tests them on 15 fixed search requests with
  hand-written answers, compares zero-, one-, few- and many-shot prompts, and
  scores adherence, correctness, injection safety, speed and memory. The XL
  category (over 15B) runs on Groq's free API: the leaderboard's XL models
  need paid hosting (Hugging Face Inference Providers had no free credit), so
  it uses the three open-weight XL models Groq serves (gpt-oss-20b,
  Qwen3.8-27B, gpt-oss-120b), which came out after the leaderboard closed.
- Part 2: "Ask in plain English" (`/search/ask/`, a local model in a Django
  view) and the automatic check of venue suggestions (an external API, Groq by
  default), written up in `README_AI.md`. The model is Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
  with the many-shot prompt (notebook Step 7): the smallest model that clears
  0.85 after the allow-list (0.92).
- Part 3: the production reflection, section 3 of `docs/notes/notes.txt`.

**Files added:** `README_AI.md`, `llm-test/` (notebook, requirements,
results), `connect/ai_search.py`, `connect/ai_venues.py`,
`connect/tests_a6.py`, `connect/templates/connect/student_ask.html`,
`connect/management/commands/download_ai_model.py`,
`connect/migrations/0002_campuslocation_ai_check.py`.

**Files changed:** `requirements.txt` (torch, transformers and their
dependencies, 61 pins); `settings/base.py` (the AI block); `models.py`
(`VenueCheck`, five `ai_*` fields on `CampusLocation`); `views.py` (the venue
form runs the check); `urls.py`; `admin.py`; `base.html` (Search stays
marked on the ask page); `student_search.html`, `location_list.html`;
`.gitignore` (weights); `.env.example` (AI keys); `privacy.html` (what the
venue check sends to Groq); `tests.py` (the venue form tests run without an
API key); the CI workflow (this branch, CPU torch, the
size check counts the web app only, `AI_LOCAL_ENABLED=0`); `db.sqlite3`
(rebuilt with migration 0002); README, notes.txt, this file.

**Decisions:** a teammate's P1-A6 branch (`p1-a6-text-intelligence`) was
reviewed first and not used: its own test failed (two links it documents were
never committed), 3 of its 15 models were never run, and its API was never
called live. This branch was built separately. float32 on CPUs, 4-bit for 2B
to 15B models (§11 trap 29).

**Verified:** 173 tests (61 in `tests_a6.py`), ruff clean, CI green. The
notebook runs end to end from its reply cache with no errors. Live on the
laptop: the search with the real model inside Django (49 s for the first
search, which loads the model, then about 10 s a search, 6.4 GB of memory)
and the venue check against Groq (5 of 5 test suggestions judged as
expected, all saved unapproved).

**Gotchas for the next person:** §11 traps 29–35.

### `main` — P1-A5 merged · 2026-10-12 · PR #10
**Merged:** `feature/p1-a5` into `main` through PR #10. Merge commit
`df81e3b`. The PR's head had passed the Deploy / test check, and nothing
surfaced at integration. The workflow then moved to `feature/p1-a6`.

### DONE `feature/p1-a5` - Manojkumar Mohankumar - 2026-10-08
**Shipped so far:** Parts 1–3 of P1-A5 on one branch cut from `main` at
`70d0ad4`.
- Part 1: django-allauth accounts with the site's own login, sign-up and
  logout pages. Every view is private unless marked `@login_not_required`.
  API paths answer `401` JSON instead of redirecting. The nav shows only
  Home, Log in and Sign up until you log in.
- Part 2: "Continue with Google" on the login and sign-up pages, with the
  client keys read from `.env`.
- Part 3: `/api/summary/` is the one public API. A Vega-Lite spec reads it
  from production, and three other uses read it too: a command-line
  report, a notebook and an Excel workbook (`docs/a5/`).

**Files added:** `connect/middleware.py`, `connect/tests_a5.py`,
`templates/account/` (`login.html`, `signup.html`, `logout.html`,
`snippets/google_button.html`), `templates/allauth/` (layout and `h1`
element), `docs/a5/` (the spec, three uses, README),
`docs/screenshots/p1-a5/` (4).

**Files changed:**
- `requirements.txt` (django-allauth and its dependencies, 29 pins);
- `settings/base.py` (apps, middleware, the accounts block) and
  `settings/production.py` (a dummy email backend);
- `quadconnect/urls.py` (`accounts/`);
- `views.py` (the home page is public, and shows its dashboard only after
  login);
- `api.py` (only `summary_api` is public and allows any origin; the docs
  page shows the real 401);
- `forms.py` (the login form subclass);
- `base.html` (nav by login state, account links, the logout button);
- `home.html` (a signed-out landing page);
- `api_docs.html`;
- the CSS (account links, the Google button);
- the A3 and A4 tests (they log in first);
- the CI workflow (signed-out and signed-in smoke test, no stored OAuth
  client);
- `db.sqlite3` (rebuilt with the account tables);
- README, notes.txt, this file.

**Decisions that differ from the plan:**
- Private by default through the middleware, not a decorator on each view.
- The Google client lives in `.env`, not in a `SocialApp` row, because the
  database is public.
- The Google Cloud project belongs to adqatar22@gmail.com: Google Cloud is
  switched off for illinois.edu accounts.
- No mail server, so there is no email verification and no password reset
  link.

**Gotchas for the next person:** §11 traps 24–28.

**Verified:** 112 tests and ruff clean. Signed out, every route but the
public two redirects or answers `401`, and signed in, every route opens (a
test walks the whole URLconf). The Vega-Lite spec draws in the editor with no
warnings, from a browser that never logged in.

**Deployed:** 2026-10-09, checked on the live site signed out, signed in,
through sign-up, and through Continue with Google with a real Google account.
**To do:** the team video.

### `main` — P1-A4 merged · 2026-10-05 · PR #9
**Merged:** `feature/p1-a4` into `main` through PR #9. Merge commit
`70d0ad4`. The PR's head had passed the Deploy / test check. Nothing
surfaced at integration. The workflow then moved to `feature/p1-a5`, so
`main` still runs no CI of its own, and there is no automatic deploy.

### BUILT `feature/p1-a4` - Manojkumar Mohankumar - 2026-10-02
**Shipped:** all four P1-A4 parts on one branch cut from `main` at `6ccd9d1`.
Part 1: `/api/summary/` and `/api/summary/matches-per-week/`, and two
Vega-Lite specs that load them through `data.url`, drawn on `/insights/` and
rendered at `/vega-lite/chart1.png` and `/vega-lite/chart2.jpg`. Part 2:
Open Trivia DB icebreakers for each match (`/api/icebreakers/?match=<id>` and
a page). Part 3: student CSV/JSON exports and `/reports/`. Part 4: frozen
requirements, the committed seed database, the install-size check.
Deployed on 2026-10-04 to PythonAnywhere's free plan (user `manojkmohan43`,
teacher `mohitg27`): <https://manojkmohan43.pythonanywhere.com/>.

**Files added:** `connect/vega_charts.py`, `connect/specs/` (2 specs),
`connect/icebreakers.py`, `connect/reports.py`, `connect/tests_a4.py`,
templates `icebreakers.html` and `reports.html`, `static/js/charts.js`,
`static/vendor/vega/` (Vega 6.4.0, Vega-Lite 6.4.3, vega-embed 7.3.0 + BSD
licences), `db.sqlite3`, `docs/screenshots/p1-a4/` (17).

**Files changed:** `requirements.txt` (pip freeze, 23 pins); `.gitignore`
(`db.sqlite3` no longer ignored); `seed_demo_data.py` (16 past matches,
fixed dates, staff accounts); `api.py` (summary endpoints, CORS, docs
examples); `charts.py` and `insights.html` (Figures 3–4); `match_detail.html`
(icebreakers button); `base.html` (Reports link, `scripts` block);
`studentprofile_list.html` (download links); `api_docs.html`; `urls.py`
(9 routes); the CSS; the CI workflow (DB check, size check, A4 smoke test);
README, notes.txt, this file.

**Decisions that differ from the plan:** the chart images are drawn with
the API's rows handed to vl-convert, not by letting it fetch `data.url`,
since a single-worker host would deadlock on a request to itself. A trivia
topic needs at least two members behind it; otherwise it is General
Knowledge. The exports leave out the email.

**Gotchas for the next person:** §11 traps 20–22, and trap 7 again: the
match list and the home page annotated a `Count` with no `order_by()`. It
went unseen while ids matched date order; the seeded history broke that.

**Audit:** three independent reviews (Django, security, WCAG 2.1 AA) before
the push. Fixed: the match order above; vega-embed's menu and hover tooltips
switched off (mouse-only downloads, tooltips that cannot be dismissed);
scrolling tables made focusable regions; card grids fit 320 px;
`/api/summary/` counts verified students and splits same-named interests;
chart images cached a minute, trivia reused 5 s; a BOM on the CSV; CI
rejects extra password hashes in the committed database.

**Verified:** 87 tests; ruff clean; `check --deploy` 0 issues; the whole CI
job on a clean checkout, including a production smoke test of 32 URLs; both
specs run in the Vega-Lite editor against the local API; the Insights page
logs nothing to the console; every page fits 320 px without sideways
scrolling.

### `main` — P1-A3 merged · 2026-09-28 · PR #6
**Merged:** `feature/p1-a3` into `main` through PR #6, merged by Kritika
Agrawal (`agrawal-kritika`). Merge commit `0c69793`.

**What surfaced at integration:** nothing. The PR's head `cb85d4c` had passed
the Deploy / test check, `main` had not moved since `df2c1d1`, and the merged
tree is byte-identical to `cb85d4c` (same tree hash).

**Verified on `main`:** the full CI job, run locally on a clean checkout of
`origin/main` (no `.env`, fresh database): ruff, `check`, no missing
migrations, seed, `verify_constraints` 11/11, 45 tests, `check --deploy`,
`collectstatic`, and the production smoke test all passed. `main` is the
default branch and the repository is public.

**Note:** the workflow runs only on pushes to `feature/p1-a3`, so `main`'s
merge commit shows no check of its own. Add `main` to its branch list to
change that.

### DONE `feature/p1-a3` - Manojkumar Mohankumar - 2026-09-24
**Shipped:** all six P1-A3 sections, solo, on one branch cut from `main` at
`df2c1d1`: detail pages linked through `get_absolute_url()`, a GET + POST
search with aggregates, the site CSS moved to `static/` with production cache
busting, two Matplotlib charts served as PNG endpoints, a POST "suggest a
venue" form on the locations CBV, and a read-only JSON API. Merged into
`main` on 2026-09-28 through PR #6 (see the merge entry above).

**Files added:** `static/css/quadconnect.css`, `static/img/logo.svg`,
`static/fonts/` (Inter + OFL), `connect/forms.py`, `connect/charts.py`,
`connect/api.py`, `connect/tests.py` (was a stub), templates
`match_detail.html`, `campuslocation_detail.html`, `student_search.html`,
`insights.html`, `api_docs.html`, `docs/screenshots/p1-a3/` (19).

**Files changed:** `requirements.txt` (whitenoise, matplotlib);
`settings/base.py` (`STATICFILES_DIRS`, WhiteNoise middleware,
`runserver_nostatic`); `settings/production.py` (manifest storage);
`models.py` (`get_absolute_url()` ×3, no migration); `views.py` (detail views,
search, `CampusLocationListView.post()`, row URLs, plural fix); `urls.py`
(10 new routes); `admin.py` (`is_approved` list-editable); `base.html`
(static assets, 8-link nav with `aria-current`, messages, `page_header`
block); every template (inline styles → classes, lists → `<ul>`);
README, notes.txt, this file.

**Decisions that differ from the plan:** match and venue detail pages shipped
in one commit because each links to the other. The NetID lookup renders from
the POST instead of redirecting, since a redirect would put the NetID in a
URL. Unapproved venues are 404 for non-staff rather than shown with a
banner, so unreviewed suggestions are never published.

**Gotchas for the next person:** see §11 traps 13–19. The expensive ones:
filtering through a relation and then annotating a `Count` over the same
relation counts only the filtered rows; model validators never reach form
widgets; a form action's `#fragment` survives the redirect after it.

**Verified:** 45 tests pass; `check` clean; `check --deploy` 0 issues with
SSL on; `makemigrations --check` no changes; `verify_constraints` 11/11; prod
with `DEBUG=False` serves `quadconnect.<hash>.css` as `immutable` + gzip; every
page fits 375 px; new colour pairs ≥ WCAG AA; keyboard reaches the skip link
first; mutation checks confirm the key tests fail when the code they guard is
removed.

### `main` — accessibility fix · 2026-09-09 · Manojkumar
**Shipped:** shared palette now meets WCAG 2.1 AA, plus explicit focus rings.

**Files changed:** `connect/templates/connect/base.html` only.

**Why:** an audit of the rendered colour combinations found five text pairs
under the 4.5:1 minimum for normal text — `--muted` on the page background
(4.47:1, used by subtitles, section headers and the footer), `--accent` on the
page background (4.46:1, links), and `--accent` on `--accent-soft` (4.33:1,
the status badges). All were marginal, none was visible by eye, all were
failures. Darkened `--muted` `#6b7280`→`#666e7b` and `--accent`
`#c8461e`→`#c0421c`; everything now measures 4.67:1 or better.

Also added `:focus-visible` outlines — the browser default ring is easy to
lose against the card background and 2.4.7 requires focus to be visible at
all times.

**Gotchas for the next person:** this lands in `base.html`, which feature
branches must not edit. Merge `main` into your branch to pick it up. If you
introduce a new colour, check it before you commit — the pairs that failed
were all "looks fine" greys and oranges.

**Verified:** all seven rendered pairs ≥4.67:1 · `manage.py check` 0 issues.

### `main` — P1-A2 scaffold · 2026-09-09 · Manojkumar
Repo initialised as `13_QuadConnect`, 15 commits. Flattened so the repo root
is the Django project root. Split settings into a package and fixed `BASE_DIR`
to three levels. Moved `SECRET_KEY` into `.env` **and rotated it**, because the
previous `django-insecure-…` value had already been written to a file.
Added `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `requirements.txt`, `base.html`,
`entity_list.html`, the home dashboard, all four named routes with
owner-marked stubs, `docs/` (wireframe PNGs, branching diagram + strategy,
notes with the VIEW REGISTER, per-developer build tasks, screenshot manifest),
and the README. Verified from a clean clone: migrate, seed, dev check, prod
`check --deploy` all pass; all six routes return 200.

### ✅ `feature/profile-views` — Kritika Agrawal — 2026-09-20
**Shipped:** `/students/` lists the verified roster with college, connection
preference, social energy and interest count, filterable by `?college=` and
paginated at 10. `/students/<pk>/` shows one student's preferences,
interests, availability and match history.

**Files added:** `connect/templates/connect/studentprofile_list.html`,
`connect/templates/connect/studentprofile_detail.html`,
`docs/screenshots/04_cbv_generic.png`, `05_list_normal.png`,
`06_list_empty.png`.

**Files changed:** `connect/views.py` — Section B2 only: both stubs replaced
with `StudentProfileListView` and `StudentProfileDetailView`.
`connect/urls.py` — both routes to `.as_view()`. `docs/notes/notes.txt`.

**Decisions that differ from the build task:** none. `template_name` is
deliberately **not** set — the templates are found by Django's naming
convention (`<app>/<model>_list.html`), which is what makes this view the
counterpoint to Prathamesh's hand-written base CBV. Matches and locations set
their template explicitly, so the project shows both conventions.

**Gotchas for the next person:**
- **`annotate()` silently breaks pagination.** Adding `Count(...)` puts a
  `GROUP BY` on the query, and Django then drops `Meta.ordering` from a
  grouped query. Pagination becomes non-deterministic — a row can appear on
  two pages or none. Django only raises `UnorderedObjectListWarning`, not an
  error, so it passes `manage.py check`. Always `.order_by()` explicitly
  after an `annotate()` on a paginated list.
- A generic CBV stops saving you much once the template needs context the
  model does not carry: the filter goes in `get_queryset()`, the filter's own
  UI state goes in `get_context_data()`, and both must call `super()`.

**Verified:** `manage.py check` 0 issues **and no warnings** · `/students/`
200 with 8 · `?college=Grainger` 3 · `?college=Nonexistent` 200 with the
empty state · `/students/1/` 200 · `/students/9999/` **404** · templates
resolved by convention · reflected `?college=` value HTML-escaped ·
`queryset.ordered` is `True`.

### ✅ `feature/match-views` — Manojkumar Mohankumar — 2026-09-09
**Shipped:** `/matches/` lists every scheduled experience with location,
activity, headcount and status, filterable by `?week=YYYY-MM-DD`.

**Files added:** `connect/templates/connect/match_list.html` (25 lines —
extends `entity_list.html`, overrides only `{% block filters %}`);
`docs/screenshots/02_fbv_render.png`.

**Files changed:** `connect/views.py` — Section A2 only: added `_match_rows()`
helper and the real `match_list` view, plus `date` and `localtime` imports.
`connect/urls.py` untouched (the stub already pointed at `views.match_list`).
`docs/notes/notes.txt` — view register, reflection, weekly log.

**Decisions that differ from the build task:** none in substance. Took
Option A for the filter (child template extending the shared one) as the task
recommended. Used `<input type="date">` rather than a `<select>` of known
weeks, because the native picker is free and a hand-typed query string still
has to be handled either way.

**Gotchas for the next person:**
- `strftime("%-I")` to strip a leading zero from the hour is **glibc-only and
  crashes on Windows**. Use `.strftime("%I:%M %p").lstrip("0")` instead. This
  bit during development.
- `entity_list.html` exposes `{% block filters %}`, so a view can add filter
  UI by extending it rather than editing it. Prathamesh should do the same
  for `?setting=` — neither of us needs to modify the shared template.
- Times are stored UTC and localised to America/Chicago by `localtime()`. A
  raw shell dump shows 19:00 where the page correctly shows 2:00 PM. Not a
  bug.

**Verified:** `manage.py check` 0 issues · `/matches/` 200 with 3 rows ·
`?week=2026-09-07` 2 rows · `?week=2026-08-31` 1 row · `?week=1999-01-01` and
`?week=banana` both 200 with *different* empty-state messages, neither a 500 ·
template chain `match_list.html → entity_list.html → base.html` ·
2 SQL queries for 3 matches, flat as rows grow · reflected `?week=` value is
HTML-escaped, no XSS · no 5xx on empty, whitespace, impossible-date,
duplicated or path-traversal query values.

**Found during the post-build audit:** the shared palette failed WCAG 2.1 AA
contrast in five places. Fixed on `main` (see the entry below) and merged in,
which is why this branch contains a merge commit.

### ✅ `feature/location-views` — Prathamesh Mulay — 2026-09-20
**Shipped:** `/locations/` lists approved public venues with capacity,
indoor/outdoor and matches hosted, filterable by `?setting=` and `?seats=`.

**Files added:** `connect/templates/connect/location_list.html`;
`docs/screenshots/03_cbv_base.png`; `docs/screenshots/07_cbv_base_empty.png`.

**Files changed:** `connect/views.py` — Section B1 only: `CampusLocationListView`
with `_build_items()` helper. `connect/urls.py` — stub swapped for
`.as_view()`. `docs/notes/notes.txt`, `docs/screenshots/README.md`.

**Decisions that differ from the build task:** added a `?seats=N` minimum-capacity
filter that the task did not ask for. It was necessary: with the seeded data
3 approved venues are indoor and 1 is outdoor, so **no `?setting=` value could
ever empty the list**, and `{% empty %}` was impossible to demonstrate. `?seats=`
is a genuine product query — Squad Connect groups are 4–8 students, so venue
capacity decides where a squad can meet — and `?seats=25` returns nothing.

**Gotchas for the next person:**
- `base.html` defines `.filter` (singular). Using `class="filters"` silently
  renders unstyled controls — no error, it just looks broken.
- When you add a filter, check that at least one value returns **zero rows**.
  A filter that can never empty the list cannot demonstrate `{% empty %}`.
- Parse query params defensively: `?seats=banana` must show the empty state,
  not a 500.
- Docs were originally committed straight to `main` rather than to the branch,
  which left `notes.txt` un-updated and a screenshot named
  `Screenshot _03_cbv_base.png`. Put doc updates on your branch with the code.

**Verified:** `manage.py check` 0 issues · `/locations/` 200 with 4 venues ·
`?setting=indoor` 3, `?setting=outdoor` 1 · `?seats=8` 3, `?seats=13` 1 ·
`?seats=25` and `?seats=banana` both 200 with the empty state, neither a 500 ·
template chain `location_list.html → entity_list.html → base.html` ·
1 SQL query · reflected `?seats=` value HTML-escaped · `entity_list.html` and
`base.html` unmodified by this branch.

### ✅ `feature/feedback-views` - Dhruv Thaker - 2026-09-20

**Shipped:** Implemented the aggregate feedback summary at `/feedback/summary/`, including total submissions, average rating, rating distribution, enjoyment metrics, and stay-connected preferences.

**Files added:** `connect/templates/connect/feedback_summary.html`.

**Files changed:** `connect/views.py` — replaced the feedback stub with an `HttpResponse` FBV using `loader.get_template()` and added aggregate feedback calculations.

**Decisions that differ from the build task:** None.

**Gotchas for the next person:**
- The feedback summary must remain aggregate-only; individual ratings and
  `private_note` values must never be displayed.
- **`loader.get_template()` names the template in a string, so a typo in the
  filename is not caught by `manage.py check`, by any import, or by any
  linter — only by requesting the page.** Load the page in a browser before
  calling a view done. `check` passing means nothing here.

**Found in review — the page returned a 500.** The template was committed as
`feedback_summary.html;` — a **trailing semicolon in the filename** — while the
view loaded `connect/feedback_summary.html`. `/feedback/summary/` raised
`TemplateDoesNotExist`. This had already been merged, so `main` was broken
until the file was renamed. Also completed in review: `notes.txt` (kind A1 was
still `TODO`, reflection blank) and the missing screenshot.

**Verified after the fix:** `manage.py check` 0 issues · `/feedback/summary/`
**200** (was 500) · every other route 200/302 · uses `loader.get_template` +
`HttpResponse`, `render()` not called · `request` passed to `.render()` ·
privacy holds — 2 stored `private_note` values, neither rendered, no
per-student attribution, privacy statement on the page · 2 SQL queries ·
empty state renders (forced in a rolled-back transaction).

## 10. Conventions

- Docstring in **every** model class: what entity, and why it exists.
- Inline comment on **every** `on_delete` explaining the choice.
- `Meta.ordering` on every model.
- Choices as `TextChoices`/`IntegerChoices`, never bare strings.
- `help_text` on any field whose meaning is not obvious.
- Admin: `list_display`, `list_filter`, `search_fields`,
  `autocomplete_fields`, inlines, fieldsets grouped **by wireframe screen**.
- Management commands idempotent (`update_or_create` / `get_or_create`).
- Views: keep row-shaping in a helper so the view body stays readable.
- Use `select_related` / `prefetch_related` / `annotate` — no query inside a
  template loop.
- 79-column source, PEP 8.
- Commit messages imperative and specific: `Add CampusLocationListView base
  CBV`, never `update stuff`.

## 11. Traps

1. **`BASE_DIR` is three levels up**, not two — the settings package added a
   directory. Get it wrong and Django creates an empty `db.sqlite3` one level
   too deep, silently.
2. **`.as_view()` is required** for CBVs in `urls.py`. Forgetting it gives
   `__init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`, which does not
   point at the cause.
3. **`DEBUG=False` stops `runserver` serving `/static/`.** A2 kept its CSS
   inline for that reason. A3 moved it to `static/` and added WhiteNoise in the
   same change. Production now needs `collectstatic --noinput` first, or every
   `{% static %}` raises (the manifest does not exist yet).
4. **`db.sqlite3` is committed (since A4), and must hold only seed data.**
   Logging in to the admin locally writes a session row; committing that
   would publish a working session key. Rebuild it instead: delete the
   file, `migrate`, `seed_demo_data`. CI fails if it holds sessions.
5. **`UniqueConstraint` cannot span relations** (see §6).
6. **`private_note` is private.** Never render it, and never show per-student
   ratings. Aggregate only.
7. **`annotate()` drops `Meta.ordering` and breaks pagination.** A `Count`
   annotation adds a `GROUP BY`, and Django ignores default ordering on a
   grouped query. Paginated rows then repeat or vanish. It surfaces only as
   `UnorderedObjectListWarning`. Always `.order_by()` after `annotate()`.
8. **`manage.py check` does not open your page.** A template referenced by
   string — `loader.get_template("...")`, `render(request, "...")`,
   `template_name` — is only resolved at request time. A filename typo passes
   every static check and 500s in the browser. One shipped to `main` as
   `feedback_summary.html;`. **Always load the page.**
9. **Check colour contrast before committing a new colour.** Five pairs in
   the original palette sat between 4.33:1 and 4.47:1 — under the 4.5:1 AA
   minimum, and invisible to the eye. Compute the ratio; do not judge it.
10. **PyMuPDF `insert_textbox` renders nothing** when the rect is too short —
   silently, no exception. Relevant if anyone regenerates the wireframe PNGs.
11. **IEEEtran `\maketitle` cannot run mid-document** — the P1-A1 paper was two
   documents merged with `pypdf`. Its LaTeX sources were deleted; changing
   those PDFs means rebuilding from scratch.
12. **8 models vs P1-A1's "recommended 3–5."** The binding rule was a minimum of
   2 per feature. Do not "fix" this by collapsing models — it would force
   nullable columns meaningless for half the rows.
13. **Filter through a relation, then `Count` it, and you count only the rows
   that matched.** `filter(interest_links__interest__name__icontains="gam")
   .annotate(n=Count("interest_links"))` gives each student the number of
   *matching* interests, not all of them, because Django reuses the join.
   Re-select first: `StudentProfile.objects.filter(pk__in=matches.values("pk"))`.
14. **Spanning a to-many relation in `filter()` duplicates rows.** A student
   with two matching interests comes back twice. Add `.distinct()` (the
   search does, and a test proves it).
15. **Model validators never reach the form widget.** `CampusLocation.capacity`
   validates 2–50, but its `ModelForm` input rendered `min="0"` (from
   `PositiveSmallIntegerField`) and no `max`. Set widget attrs in the form.
16. **A form action's `#fragment` survives the redirect after the POST.** The
   venue form posts to `#suggest`, so after Post/Redirect/Get the browser
   reopened at the form, below the success message. Give the redirect its
   own fragment (`#main`).
17. **CSS specificity: `.form [aria-invalid="true"]` loses to
   `.form input[type="text"]`.** The error border never showed. Qualify it
   with the element (`.form input[aria-invalid="true"]`).
18. **Never `pyplot` in a view.** It keeps every figure in a global registry
   until `plt.close()` (a leak per request), and its default backend here is
   TkAgg, a GUI. Build `matplotlib.figure.Figure` directly and save into
   `BytesIO`. First Matplotlib import builds a font cache (~45 s, once).
19. **Windows tooling:** text-mode `subprocess` stdin turns LF line endings
   into CRLF, so a patch piped to `git apply` stops matching; pass bytes.
   Bash heredocs can eat backslashes in inline Python (this entry lost its
   own escape examples that way); write the script to a file instead.
20. **Vega-Lite warns "Dropping fit-y because spec has discrete height"** for
   `"width": "container"` with a step height (`{"step": 20}`), even though
   nothing is dropped. The bar chart uses a fixed height to keep the
   console and the editor's log clean.
21. **Open Trivia DB answers a second request within 5 seconds with HTTP 429**
   (`response_code` 5), per IP address. `raise_for_status()` turns it into
   an `HTTPError`; the code maps it to 503 with `Retry-After`. Tests mock
   `requests.get`; a manual check needs a 5-second gap between calls.
22. **vl-convert starts its renderer on the first image** a process draws:
   a few seconds, rarely much longer on a busy Windows machine. The
   `--noreload` dev server also caches templates, so restart it after
   editing one.
23. **PythonAnywhere from Windows:** a console created through the API only
   starts once it is opened in a browser. Git Bash rewrites `/home/...`
   arguments into Windows paths (set `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`). And the live
   `db.sqlite3` on the server lived in the repository (`--skip-worktree`)
   until A5. Since A5 it is `~/quadconnect-data/db.sqlite3` (`DJANGO_DB_PATH`),
   so `git pull` never touches live accounts.
24. **With `LoginRequiredMiddleware`, every test client must log in.** A
   test that gets a page now gets a redirect to the login page instead.
   Log in once in a base class's `setUp()`, and every subclass that
   defines its own `setUp()` must call `super().setUp()`: 20 tests failed
   until two classes did.
25. **Creating users with a password makes tests slow.** Each hash costs
   real time. Create test users with `create_user("name")` (no password)
   and `force_login()`: the suite went from 126 s to about 63 s.
26. **allauth's login form links to password reset** in the password
   field's help text, and that needs a mail server we do not have. It is
   removed in `connect.forms.LoginForm`, wired in with `ACCOUNT_FORMS`.
27. **Google Cloud is switched off for illinois.edu accounts**, and
   Google refuses to sign in to Gmail in a browser driven by automation
   ("This browser or app may not be secure"). Set up OAuth clients in a
   normal browser with a personal Google account.
28. **`ruff check .` lints notebooks too.** A committed `.ipynb` under
   `docs/` is checked like any `.py` file, so CI fails on a notebook's
   lint error.
29. **bfloat16 is slow on a CPU without native support.** On our Ryzen 7
   6800HS, Qwen2.5-1.5B took 49.8 s to read a 503-token prompt in bfloat16
   and 6.9 s in float32; 4-bit NF4 computing in float32 took 14.7 s. Use
   float32 on CPUs and bfloat16 on GPUs (both the notebook and
   `ai_search.py` do).
30. **The Hugging Face cache on Windows** copies files instead of linking
   them unless Developer Mode is on (a warning, not an error), and
   downloads without `HF_TOKEN` are rate-limited (about 12 MB/s here).
31. **ruff's import sorter wraps imports longer than 88 characters**, even
   though line length (E501) is not checked: write long imports in the
   wrapped form, or `ruff check --fix` does it.
32. **`python -I` ignores `PYTHONIOENCODING`.** Print non-ASCII text from an
   isolated script with `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")`.
33. **"afternoon" contains "noon".** Keyword patterns need word boundaries
   (`\bnoon`); a test caught the keyword parser reading "Saturday
   afternoon" as midday.
34. **Never let a test reach a real model or API.** The venue form tests
   (P1-A3) post suggestions, so they run with `AI_API_KEY=""`; the A6 tests
   patch `generate_reply` and `requests.post`; CI sets
   `AI_LOCAL_ENABLED=0`, or a stray call would download gigabytes.
35. **`torch` from PyPI on Linux is the CUDA build** (several GB). CI and
   any CPU-only Linux host should add
   `--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`; the free
   PythonAnywhere plan cannot hold torch at all, and does not need it (the
   search falls back to keywords).

## 12. Assignment history

### P1-A1 — Product + Data Models + UI/UX (35 pts) — submitted
Four uploads: the TCC workbook, the Idea Description PDF (rebuilt in genuine
IEEE two-column after the original was single-column), the Wireframes PDF
(rebuilt low-fidelity after the original was high-fidelity Figma screenshots,
with those kept as an iteration-v2 appendix), and the Django project ZIP.
Deliverables live outside this repo in the workspace `SUBMIT/` folder.

### P1-A2 — Fullstack Development + GitHub Secrets (30 pts) — submitted
Section 1 structure/security/GitHub done on `main`; the four feature
branches merged one at a time (see §9). Submission was one item: the public
GitHub repository URL.

### P1-A3 — URLs, ORM, static files, charts, forms, API (60 pts) — merged, to submit
Built by Manojkumar alone on `feature/p1-a3`; all six sections done and
verified (§9). Merged into `main` on 2026-09-28 through PR #6. Submission is
one item, the public repository URL, due Mon 2026-09-28 at 23:59. The
notes.txt answers the assignment asks for are in its section 2; screenshots
in `docs/screenshots/p1-a3/`.

### P1-A4 — APIs, Vega-Lite charts, exports, static files, deployment (40 pts) — merged, submitted
Built by Manojkumar on `feature/p1-a4` (§9). Due Mon 2026-10-05 at 23:59.
Submission: the Vega-Lite specs (`connect/specs/`) and screenshots of the
working charts (`docs/screenshots/p1-a4/`), in the repository. Deployed to
PythonAnywhere on 2026-10-04: <https://manojkmohan43.pythonanywhere.com/>, user `manojkmohan43`, teacher
`mohitg27`. Merged into `main` through PR #9 on 2026-10-05.

### P1-A5.1 — Authentication, Google OAuth, public API, project video (50 pts) — merged, submitted
Built on `feature/p1-a5` (§9). Due Mon 2026-10-12. No new repository; the
live site must run the logged-in version. Submission:
- the public API's production URL,
  <https://manojkmohan43.pythonanywhere.com/api/summary/>;
- the GitHub URL;
- `docs/a5/group-13-vega-lite-API-demo.txt` and its editor screenshot
  (`docs/screenshots/p1-a5/01_vega_editor_public_api.png`);
- the team video as a downloadable file, 300 seconds at most. It opens with
  a slide (members and emails, product name and title, course) and the
  required spoken introduction, then demonstrates the live site.

Merged into `main` through PR #10 on 2026-10-12; the video is in the
workspace `SUBMIT/` folder.

### P1-A5.2 — Individual deployment and external feedback (20 pts, individual)
Each member deploys the site on their own PythonAnywhere account and collects
written feedback from five people outside the class. Dhruv's deployment
(`dthaker6.pythonanywhere.com`) uses the team's Google client; its callback
was added on 2026-10-13.

### P1-A6 — Text Intelligence (100 pts) — building
Built on `feature/p1-a6` (§9). Due Mon 2026-10-19. Submission: the GitHub URL
with the Django code and `llm-test/ai_prototype.ipynb` (Route A, so no
fine-tuning notebook). Part 2 is `README_AI.md`; Part 3 is section 3 of
`docs/notes/notes.txt`.

### Next
The matching algorithm remains the biggest open design question:
`compatibility_score` and `match_reason` are fields that nothing computes
outside seed data. Weighting, normalisation to 0–100, squad formation for
4–8 people, tie-breaking, starvation avoidance, and generating `match_reason`
from the same computation so the explanation cannot drift from the score.
